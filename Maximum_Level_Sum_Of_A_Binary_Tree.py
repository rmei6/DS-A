# Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

# Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# Level 1 sum = 1.
# Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
# Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
# So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
# Output: 2
