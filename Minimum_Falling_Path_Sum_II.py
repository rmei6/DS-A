# Given an n x n integer matrix grid, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.

# A falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of grid such that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: 13
# Explanation: 
# The possible falling paths are:
# [1,5,9], [1,5,7], [1,6,7], [1,6,8],
# [2,4,8], [2,4,9], [2,6,7], [2,6,8],
# [3,4,8], [3,4,9], [3,5,7], [3,5,9]
# The falling path with the smallest sum is [1,5,7], so the answer is 13.
# Example 2:

# Input: grid = [[7]]
# Output: 7
 

# Constraints:

# n == grid.length == grid[i].length
# 1 <= n <= 200
# -99 <= grid[i][j] <= 99
