# Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
# Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

 

# Example 1:



# Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
# Output: 3
# Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
# Example 2:

# Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
# # Output: 1

        while a > 0 or b > 0 or c > 0:
            bit_a = a & 1
            bit_b = b & 1
            bit_c = c & 1

            if bit_c == 0:
                flips += (bit_a + bit_b)  
            else:
                if bit_a == 0 and bit_b == 0:
                    flips += 1  

            a >>= 1
            b >>= 1
            c >>= 1

        return flips
