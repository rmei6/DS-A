# Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.

# After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

 

# (Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
# Output: [3,1]
# Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
# Example 2:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
# Output: [1,2,4]
# Example 3:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
# Output: [1]
 

# Constraints:

# The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
# Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
