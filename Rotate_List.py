# Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
# Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
# Output: [2,0,1]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 0 <= k <= 2 * 109

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
